Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! I am Saravanan R, a passionate Java developer and full-stack web developer. With a strong foundation in programming and a keen eye for creating efficient, user-friendly applications, I bring ideas to life through clean and effective code.

My skills span across backend development using Java, Spring, and Hibernate, as well as crafting visually appealing and responsive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. With expertise in database management using MySQL and hands-on experience building interactive web applications, I am committed to delivering projects that are both innovative and impactful.

Explore my projects, including event registration systems, CRUD operations for restaurant menu management, and other practical applications. Beyond coding, I enjoy photography, video editing, and gaming, which fuel my creativity and problem-solving mindset.
